# 📝 Module 0: Introduction

Welcome to **Module 0: Introduction**, where we lay the groundwork for understanding Git and GitHub.

---

## 📚 **What is Git?**

Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)** created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage Linux kernel development. It helps developers:

- Track changes in code over time  
- Collaborate with others efficiently  
- Maintain a complete, secure, and **immutable history** of project development

Unlike traditional version control systems like SVN or CVS, **Git is distributed**, meaning every developer has a full copy of the repository with complete history. This design provides:

- ⚡ **Fast operations** (commits, diffs, merges happen locally)  
- 🔒 **Data integrity** (each commit has a unique SHA-1 hash)  
- 🌐 **Robust collaboration** without a single point of failure

---

## 🌐 **What is GitHub?**

GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories and enhances them with powerful collaboration features, including:

- Pull requests and code reviews  
- Issue tracking and project boards  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation  
- Wikis and documentation support  
- Insights and analytics for projects

Launched in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018, **GitHub acts as the remote home for your repositories**, enabling:

✅ Easy code sharing  
✅ Open-source contribution  
✅ Team workflows with review and approvals  
✅ Integration with countless developer tools

## 🆚 **Git vs GitHub**

| Feature | Git | GitHub |
|---|---|---|
| Type | Version Control System | Repository Hosting & Collaboration Platform |
| Works Offline | Yes | No (mostly online) |
| Interface | Command Line | Web-based with GUI |
| Primary Use | Local code version control | Sharing, managing, and collaborating on Git repositories |
| Owned By | Open Source (Linux Foundation) | Microsoft |

🔑 **Key takeaway:** *Git manages your code locally; GitHub connects it with the world.*

---

## 🔧 **Why Should You Learn Git?**

✅ **Track and revert code changes** easily  
✅ **Work safely with experiments** using branches  
✅ **Collaborate seamlessly** with teams, preventing code conflicts  
✅ **Contribute to open-source projects** with confidence  
✅ **Enhance job prospects**, as Git is a core industry-standard skill

> *Every professional software project today uses Git in some form.*

## 🚀 **Installing Git**

### **Windows**

1. Download from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)  
2. Run the installer with default options  
3. Verify installation:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

### **Mac**

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
git --version
````

Or install Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git --version
```

---

## ⚙️ **Basic Configuration**

After installation, configure your global username and email (used for commit authorship):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Verify configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

🔑 **Tip:** You can override these settings per repository by omitting `--global`.

## 📝 **Additional Notes**

* **GUI Tools:** While Git is primarily command-line, tools like GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree, or VS Code Git integration simplify workflows for beginners.
* **Other Hosting Services:** Alternatives to GitHub include GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps. All use Git under the hood but provide different integrations and pricing models.
* **SSH Keys:** For secure push/pull operations without entering your password each time, configure SSH keys with your GitHub account. (Covered in Remote Repositories module)

---

## 💡 **Summary**

In this module, you learned:

* What Git and GitHub are
* Key differences between Git and GitHub
* Why Git is essential for developers
* How to install and configure Git
* Contextual notes on GUI tools and alternative hosting platforms

👉 Proceed to [Module 1: Git Architecture & Workflow](../1_architecture_workflow/README.md) to understand **how Git works internally** before diving into practical commands.
